Erros:
	The errors were usually the use of putting A <body> within a body or a <style> within style along with the style put in as a child of the element body. Just because it worked doesnt mean it is appropriate in this case is what really happened and so I had to do a lot of those changes more than 10. Another one is the label where the tags are used to label inputs in form, which need to be present and visible in the document.Also in the code I did it had the error " <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male" required>
    <label for="Male"></label> " where due to the id and value not having a Male word instead of I used a lower case. So it seems at this point certain things needs the same case of letters. In this case I saw it on the internet and just used it so the same case of it being of a possible use but not appropriate. At the same time it may cause errors further down the road upon continous use.
